# ðŸšŒ Red Bus Project

# Overview:

The Red Bus Project is a web scraping and visualization tool built with Selenium to extract bus information from the RedBus website. It stores the data in a MySQL database and provides an interactive visualization interface using Streamlit. The goal is to deliver insights into bus schedules, prices, ratings, and seat availability.

# Features:

Data Scraping: Automates the extraction of key information such as bus routes, departure/arrival times, bus types, ratings, and prices using Selenium.
Data Storage: Scraped data is stored in MySQL, enabling efficient query operations and structured data management.
Visualization: An interactive Streamlit app allows users to explore and analyze the bus data through charts and filters. 
## Insights include: 
      * Bus timings (departure and arrival)
      * Price comparisons across different routes
      * Duration of trips
      * Star ratings and seat availability of buses
      
# Technologies Used:

* Selenium: To automate web scraping from RedBus.
* MySQL: As the database for storing the scraped data.
* Streamlit: For creating a web-based interface for visualizing the data.
* Python: For all backend operations, including scraping, data processing, and visualization.
